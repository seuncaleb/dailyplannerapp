# Daily Planner

## Your Task

This is a daily planner that allows you add task for every working hour and tracks past, current and future time. For this project I made use of the following 

* Objects
* Arrays
* Call back functions
* Regular functions
* If/else statements
* Nested Conditional Statements
* Event Listeners
* local storage 
* Jquery
* Jquery Moments


## Lessons Learned 

* How to use local storage function to store data
* How to make use of event listeners
* How to make use query selectors
* How to make use of Jquery Moments

## Challenges 
 * Function wasn't going through all the questions in my object
 * calling locak storage to keep reminder on screen after refresh
